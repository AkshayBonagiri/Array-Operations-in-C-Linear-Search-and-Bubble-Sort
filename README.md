## 🧠 Algorithms Covered

This repository covers a range of basic and essential algorithms that are commonly asked in interviews and foundational in programming:

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**: Scans the array element-by-element to find a target value.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently finds a target in a sorted array by dividing the search range in half. Implemented both iteratively and recursively.

### 📊 Sorting Techniques
- **Basic Sorting**: Demonstrates sorting logic (like selection sort or bubble sort) to arrange elements in ascending order.

### 📈 Array-Based Logic
- **Finding Max/Min**: Identifies the largest and smallest numbers in an array.
- **Unique Values Detection**: Detects and prints unique elements from a list.
- **Sum and Product**: Calculates the total sum and product of array elements.

These programs build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and pave the way for more advanced topics like recursion, dynamic programming, and data structures.
